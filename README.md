# DuolingoJS Bot
This is an outdated version of the primitive JavaScript bot, used to automate the [Duolingo](https://invite.duolingo.com/BDHTZTB5CWWKSJOACYTXH5VCLI) website (this is my personal referral link).

The bot was responsible for completing Duolingo stories in the English-Ukrainian cource.

In addition to some pre-defined right answers, it has a logic to randomly pick a random answer to unknown questions, and if it's correct, the bot inserts it to the library.
You can still use the bot for any other Duolingo stories, based on different languages, but there is no guarantee it will frely work. So, feel free to adjust its outdated logic by updating the CSS selectors (which are often updated on the Duolingo website, as they are being automatically generated after each new Duolingo release).
